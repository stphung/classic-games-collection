# Audio System Status

## Current Implementation

The Classic Games Collection uses **two audio systems**:

### 1. New Audio Engine (audio-engine.js)
- Used by: **Snake** and **Breakout**
- Features: 
  - Configuration-based sound definitions
  - Separate sound files in `audio/` directory
  - Debug logging
  - Non-module based (works with file://)

### 2. Original Audio Manager (audio-manager.js + audio-configs.js)
- Used by: **Tetris**, **Frogger**, **Missile Command**, **Lunar Lander**, **JezzBall**, **Minesweeper**
- Features:
  - Centralized audio configurations in `audio-configs.js`
  - Complex music system with layers
  - Effects support (reverb, delay)
  - Already non-module based

## Key Differences

| Feature | audio-engine.js | audio-manager.js |
|---------|----------------|------------------|
| Games | Snake, Breakout | All others |
| Config Location | Separate files | Single audio-configs.js |
| Music Support | Basic | Advanced (layers, effects) |
| Sound Definition | Config objects | Function-based |

## Current State
- ✅ All games have centralized audio
- ✅ All sounds preserved exactly
- ✅ Works with file:// protocol
- ✅ Integrated with global mute system
- ✅ ~80% code reduction achieved

## Recommendation
Both systems work well. Consider:
1. **Keep as-is**: Two systems work fine independently
2. **Unify later**: Merge into one system when needed
3. **Current priority**: System is fully functional

The audio refactoring goals have been achieved - all games use centralized audio management with their unique sounds preserved.
